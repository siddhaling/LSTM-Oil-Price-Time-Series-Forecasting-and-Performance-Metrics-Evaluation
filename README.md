# LSTM-Oil-Price-Time-Series-Forecasting-and-Performance-Metrics-Evaluation
LSTM Oil Price Time Series Forecasting and Performance Metrics Evaluation
Python code to perform oil price forecasting. This is an univariate LSTM model and then perform metrics evaluation

Package Version\
python 3.6.8\
pandas 0.24.1\
Keras 2.2.4\


This python demonstrates the univariate oil price forecasting using LSTM deep learning model\
The sliding window is used to creating training and validation in the time series data\
The standard scalers provided by Sklearn is used.\
Both the time the forecasted and actual oil prices are plotted to visualize.\

Then using sklearn.metrics and math various metrics such as
1. Mean Absolute Error
2. Mean Squared Error 
3. Root Mean Square Error
4. R2 Score
5. Adjusted R2 

are computed on predicted data.
